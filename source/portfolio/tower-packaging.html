                        After successfully launching the Tower brand from £1m to £25m over 2 years, we were asked to give the packaging full makeover and provide a cohesive design approach across all sub-ranges, which had become fragmented over time. In just 3 weeks we delivered an entirely re-designed suite of over 40 packaging artworks complete with supporting imagery, which were unveiled at Spring Fair 2017.

                    In a price range dominated by cheap cut-out photography and loud packaging designs, the new Tower packaging really stands out from the crowd. Our efficient in-house workflow allows us to quickly produce photography that competes at a similar price point but offers consumers a much more sophisticated style.

                    The top tier packaging is reserved for Tower's luxury ranges. Each shot is carefully planned and edited, and the packaging is refined with smaller sales features. High-end products are sold on a track record of quality, so we're boosting Tower's brand reputation with a consistently premium style that will only be available through major reputable retailers.
