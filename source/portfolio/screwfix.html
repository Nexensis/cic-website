                    Following a successful period of growth, Screwfix became guilty of forgetting their core range, falling out of love with screws. Screws are their heritage products, it is where it all began. However without the care and attention a brand needs, the packaging for these had become stale. <br /><br />
                    With such a broad range of benefits and applications we developed a design treatment to suit all. One family made up of many individual personalities.

                    The solution was a bold typographical design. A no-nonsense approach to each screw and it’s proposed use. 
                    <br /> <br />
                    Following the success of this project we were tasked with developing a whole host of own brands. Updates to the No-Nonsense range followed, along with the birth of the Site range of PPE (personal protection equipment); all supported with trade launches.

                    No Nonsense Social Lubricant was created as a promotional beer label. Handed out to a select few, these beers were used to celebrate new store and product launches further increasing the No Nonsense brand awareness. <br /> <br />
                    A straight talking brand, No Nonsense says it how it is. With a humorous approach to the features and benefits these beers went down a storm.
