                    We created a collection of A5 hardback books each featuring 40 simple recipes that demonstrate the breadth of meal opportunities to be enjoyed when cooking at home from blending juices to perfecting pressure cooking. Our China-based office handled the printing of tens of thousands of hardback copies, creating an efficient and convenient distribution channel between the client, design teams, printers and factories.
