                <div class="case-study-section-paragraph">
                    Following the success of Leisure Grow’s Noma Christmas catalogue we were approached by the outdoor living brand to launch its new range of premium outdoor furniture. Our brief was to convey the quality and craftsmanship of each item to a key trade audience.

                We quickly identified CGI technology as the best way to capture the collection in aspirational exotic locations throughout the world. Our award winning CGI artists developed pioneering new technology to re-create complex details including the rattan weave of furniture materials and outdoor foliage to appear in a challenging high resolution print format.

            <p class="case-study-section-paragraph">
                The new imagery and packaging was a resounding success with both Leisure Grow and their customers.
            </p>
            <p class="case-study-section-quote">
                “This is our first foray into CGI, and we’re impressed with the incredibly detailed images which really do justice to the quality of each furniture piece and every detail of its design. The end product gave us the tools we needed to introduce our latest LG Outdoor collection to a key trade audience in a visually engaging and aspirational way.”
